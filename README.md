# 🌡️ Heatwave Modelling & Intervention Analysis

Welcome to the Heatwave Modelling project! This repository simulates the health impacts of heatwaves and evaluates intervention strategies using a compartmental model. The project generates synthetic weather and health data, runs scenario analyses, and produces insightful visualizations to support public health decision-making.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Realistic temperature, pollution, and humidity patterns for a simulated heatwave.
- **Compartmental Modelling:** Tracks susceptible, hospitalized, recovered, and deceased populations under different scenarios.
- **Intervention Scenarios:** Compares baseline, public awareness, hospital capacity expansion, vulnerability reduction, and combined strategies.
- **Visualizations:**
  - 📈 Line chart of hospital admissions
  - 📊 Bar charts comparing deaths, peak hospitalizations, and burden duration
  - 🌡️ Heatmaps of temperature, pollution, and health impacts
